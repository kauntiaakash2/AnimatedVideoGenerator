# Animated Video Generator

A powerful tool for generating animated videos programmatically. Built using Python, this project leverages video processing libraries to create customizable, smooth animations from data or scripted instructions.

## 🚀 Features

* **Frame Generation:** Create individual frames with custom designs.
* **Animation Building:** Convert frames into smooth animations.
* **Custom Transitions:** Apply transition effects between frames.
* **Flexible Input:** Integrate images, text, and shapes seamlessly.
* **Export Options:** Save animations in various formats.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* MoviePy
